# n8n: CVE-2025-68613

Now, it is time to exploit it. We will be using the “friendly” exploit from within your browser payload available [here](https://github.com/wioui/n8n-CVE-2025-68613-exploit). For your convenience, the exploit code is pasted below:

```
{{ (function(){ return this.process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('id').toString() })() }}
```

First, you need to start a new workflow. Depending on what you see after logging in, you may need to click “**Start from scratch**”.

To carry out the outlined instructions in the original PoC, click “**Add first step**”.

And search for and add **Manual Trigger**.

Attached to the Manual Trigger that we just added, add an “**Edit Fields (Set)**” option.

For the final step, click “**Add Field**,” which will allow you to add a name and a value. Write something like “result” or “exploit” as the name; furthermore, paste the exploit code in the value field. Once you click “**Execute step**”, you will see your command getting executed. In the screenshot below, we can see the output of the id command.

As explained in the previous task, you can replace `id` with any command of your choice.
