Lets Start !

Let's begin. We are provided with a login page and a valid email address: `ctf-player@picoctf.org`. Our first step is to analyze the login interface and attempt to identify any weaknesses or bypass techniques that may allow us to access the portal.     &#x20;

let's take a look at the page’s source code to see if the developer left any useful information or hidden functionality that we can leverage.

We found a cipher string in the source code, so let's attempt to decode it. Using CyberChef, we can identify that the text is encoded with ROT13. Let’s decode it first to understand what information it reveals.

**"NOTE: Jack - temporary bypass: use header `X-Dev-Access: yes`"**

This indicates that the login page can be bypassed by adding the custom header `X-Dev-Access: yes` in our request. Using this header allows us to access the protected page and retrieve the flag.



Next, we capture the login request in Burp Suite and modify it by adding the header `X-Dev-Access: yes`. We keep the provided email and enter any value as the password. After sending the modified request, we can observe how the server responds and whether the bypass grants us access.

After sending the modified request, the server responds with **200 OK**, confirming the bypass was successful. As a result, we gain access to the protected page and obtain the flag.

```
Flag: picoCTF{brut4_f0rc4_83812a02}
```
