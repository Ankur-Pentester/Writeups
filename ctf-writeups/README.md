### 🎯 Why I Solve CTFs?

CTFs help me:

* Build real-world pentesting skills
* Improve exploitation mindset
* Practice recon and enumeration
* Master web, API, AD, mobile, and privilege escalation techniques
* Learn new vulnerabilities and payloads
* Stay consistent with my cybersecurity learning

CTFs simulate real-world attack scenarios, making them one of the best ways to grow as a pentester.
