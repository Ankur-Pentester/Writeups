# Skills & Expertise

This section highlights the core technical areas I work in as a cybersecurity professional.\
From web exploitation to tunneling, Active Directory attacks, and malware fundamentals —\
I believe in understanding attacks deeply, not just running tools.

***

### 🕸 Web Application Penetration Testing

* Manual vulnerability discovery
* Advanced XSS (DOM, Reflected, Stored)
* SQL Injection (Manual + UNION-based)
* SSTI, LFI/RFI, Command Injection
* Authentication & Session attacks
* Business Logic vulnerabilities
* File upload bypass & RCE exploitation
* Burp Suite (Repeater, Intruder, Extensions)

***

### 🔗 API Security & Web Services

* BOLA (IDOR • Broken Object Level Authorization)
* Broken Authentication
* Privilege escalation in APIs
* Parameter tampering
* Swagger/OpenAPI-based exploitation
* JWT weaknesses
* Rate limit bypass

***

### 🛡 Active Directory & Windows Security

* Enumeration (BloodHound, PowerView)
* Kerberoasting & AS-REP Roasting
* LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning
* SMB attacks & hash capture
* Password spraying
* ACL abuse & privilege escalation
* Domain trust understanding
* Hardening fundamentals

***

### 🐧 Linux Privilege Escalation & System Security

* Sudo misconfigurations
* SUID/SGID exploitation
* Capabilities abuse
* Cronjob abuse
* Kernel exploits
* SSH keys & persistence methods
* Post-exploitation enumeration

***

### 🌐 Tunneling, Pivoting & Advanced Networking

* Meterpreter tunneling (SOCKS, autoroute, Reverse port forwarding)
* SSH tunneling (remote & reverse)
* ICMP tunneling (ptunnel-ng)
* DNS tunneling
* Proxychains & pivoting techniques
* AV/Firewall evasion basics

***

### 📱 Mobile Application Security (Android)

* APK decompilation & analysis
* Manifest review
* Hardcoded keys extraction
* API interception
* Root detection bypass basics
* MobSF analysis workflow

***

### 🦠 Malware & Reverse Engineering (Basics)

* Malware behavior analysis
* Static vs dynamic analysis
* Payload generation concepts
* Encryption/obfuscation basics
* Lab environment setup
* Windows internals fundamentals

***

### 🛠 Tools & Framework Expertise

* Nmap, ffuf, Gobuster
* Subfinder, Assetfinder, Amass
* Nuclei (Custom templates)
* Httpx, Katana
* Burp Suite (Pro workflow)
* Metasploit Framework
* Netcat, Socat
* Wireshark, tcpdump
* MobSF
* Apktool, JADX
* Python security scripts

***

### 💻 Programming & Scripting

* **Python** (automation, scanners, recon tools)
* **Bash** (automation, payload workflows)
* Understanding of JS for XSS & client-side attacks

***

### 🎯 What Makes Me Strong

* Fast exploitation mindset
* Strong manual testing skills
* Ability to think like an attacker
* Consistent CTF practice
* Deep documentation (this GitBook)
* Real-world attack understanding, not just theoretical
* Curiosity to break things ethically

***

I continue to build these skills every day through CTFs, labs, real-world challenges, and continuous learning.
