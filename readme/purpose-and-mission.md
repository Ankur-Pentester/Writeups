# Purpose & Mission

My purpose in cybersecurity goes far beyond solving challenges or finding vulnerabilities.\
For me, this journey represents growth, discipline, creativity, and the desire to make an impact.

As I kept learning and improving, I realized that cybersecurity is not just about hacking systems —\
it's about understanding them deeply, sharing knowledge, and empowering others.

### 🎯 Why I Created Nexxel Security

Nexxel Security started with a simple thought:

**“If I can understand something deeply… I should teach it simply.”**

I wanted to create a space where:

* Ethical hacking is explained in a clean and practical way
* People can learn through **speedrun videos, walkthroughs, and real-world examples**
* Beginners don’t feel lost or confused
* CTF players get simple, fast, structured guidance
* My entire learning journey remains recorded and accessible to all

Nexxel Security exists because I want learning cybersecurity to be **easy, enjoyable, and ethical**.

Not for money.\
Not for fame.\
But because sharing knowledge creates impact.

* Break complex topics into clear, understandable explanations
* Share everything I learn — openly and consistently

Every script I write, every CTF I solve, every video I upload —\
