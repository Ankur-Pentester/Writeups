# My Story

My journey into cybersecurity didn’t start with a plan — it started with curiosity.

From the beginning, I was always drawn toward computers, problems, and the thrill of understanding how things actually work. But it wasn’t until I discovered hacking that everything finally made sense. The idea that a system can be broken, understood, and secured — that feeling changed everything for me.

I started small. Basic commands, simple tools, random experiments… nothing serious.\
But slowly, curiosity turned into passion. And passion turned into discipline.

### 🔥 The Turning Point

The real shift came when I found platforms like **TryHackMe** and **HackTheBox**.\
Suddenly, I wasn’t just watching hacking content — I was living it.

There was a time when I spent **12+ hours daily** solving labs.\
Day after day, challenge after challenge.\
Not for certification.\
Not for show-off.\
Just for the excitement of learning something new.

Within months:

* I reached the Top 1% on TryHackMe (Current Global Rank: \~5000)
* Completed multiple learning paths
* Solved advanced challenges
* Built a strong foundation in pentesting, AD attacks, tunneling, recon, exploitation, and malware fundamentals

Cybersecurity stopped being a hobby.\
It became a lifestyle.

### ⚡ The Challenges

Like every journey, mine wasn’t smooth:

* Laptop issues
* Distractions
* Balancing studies and hacking
* Self-doubt
* No external guidance
* And lots of late-night debugging alone

But one thing never changed —\
**I didn’t stop.**

Even when the world slept, I was learning, breaking, understanding, improving.

This consistency built me.

### 🛡 How Nexxel Security Was Born

As I went deeper into cybersecurity, I realized that I didn’t just enjoy hacking —\
I enjoyed **teaching**, **explaining**, and **breaking things fast in a clean, efficient way**.

Whenever I solved a CTF, exploited a machine, or learned a new technique,\
I naturally wanted to share it with others in a simple, fast, and practical format.

That’s when the idea of Nexxel Security started.

I didn’t want to only become good at hacking —\
I wanted to help others learn it too.

Through Nexxel Security, my goals became:

* Creating **speedrun-style hacking videos**
* Publishing **ethical hacking content**
* Breaking down **complex concepts into easy explanations**
* Providing **CTF walkthroughs** that actually teach the mindset
* Helping beginners take their first steps in cybersecurity
* Sharing my research, scripts, notes, and real experience

Nexxel Security wasn’t created for money or fame.

It was created because: **I wanted a place where learning hacking was simple, fast, ethical, and accessible for everyone.**

This GitBook, my videos, and my writeups are all part of that mission.

### 🌱 The Journey Today

Today, I am:

* A cybersecurity professional
* A pentester
* A bug bounty learner
* A CTF player
* A content creator
* A community builder
* And someone who documents everything I learn

Every day I push myself:\
More tools.\
More labs.\
More tunneling.\
More exploitation.\
More learning.

Because growth never stops.

### 🚀 The Future

My goal is simple:

**To become one of the strongest cybersecurity professionals in India —**\
**and build Nexxel Security into a platform that protects people from online scams and fraud.**

I want to educate, expose, secure, and empower.

I want to give back to the community that built me.

This GitBook is not just a documentation site.\
It is a reflection of my journey —\
from curiosity to passion,\
from passion to purpose.

The story is still being written.\
And I’m just getting started.
